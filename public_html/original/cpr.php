			Yes indeed, they are!  Your Favorite Chicago Sounds is developing a partnership with Chicago Public Radio and both organizations are excited about the collaboration. Chicago Public Radio will audition YFCS-collected sounds for broadcast as part of the Sonic Soundscapes project and they will share audio received by the Sonic Soundscapes project with YFCS for use in the YFCS project. We'll also be working with Chicago Public Radio to network volunteer producers for both projects which means extra publicity and opportunities for everyone.
