            Why do we need your name and email?
        </p>
        <p>
            We will ONLY post your name, IF you give us permission to.

            We'd like to record the sounds you submit and sometimes we need your help to
            do so. Sometimes we have questions about the best time to capture a sound,
            or about the exact locations. Sometimes we'd just like to chat, and
            sometimes we'd like to record you talking about your favorite sound, if we
            think it'd make a good story. You don't have to talk to us, of course, you
            can even submit all of this anonymously (but we'd like it if we could give
            you credit for your submissions). We'd also like to send you updates on the
            project, unless you tell us not to, by unchecking the box. Rest assured, we
            will NEVER sell or give your info to anyone else.
