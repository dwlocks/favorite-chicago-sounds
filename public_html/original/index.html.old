        what Chicagoans think about their city's soundscape and to reveal the Chicago of the ear. Please let us know your response<br>
        to the questions below and contribute to a unique audio portrait of the city. Be as specific or detailed as you like. The sounds will be recorded and used for a CD, &quot;Your Favorite Chicago Sounds.&quot;</p>
        <p class="style5">  The &quot;Favorite Sounds&quot; project originated in London and has been carried out in Beijing and other world cities. The CD<br>
  &quot;Your Favourite London Sounds&quot; was released in 2001 and a CD for Beijing is planned for this year. The long-term aim is to
          build up an overall sonic idea of what people find positive about the ever-changing sound of their cities.<br>
