      <br>We're currently developing a Google map of Chicago that will feature our catalogued sounds.  Check back soon for updates!  

      <!--FCS is currently developing a Sound Maps project in Chicago's  Hyde Park community that we plan to exhibit in the November 2007 Outer Ear Festival of Sound. We're working on it in conjunction with the Stockyard Institute and Hyde Park Art Center. <br>
      <br>
      This is how it will work: we survey residents of Hyde Park about their favorite neighborhood sounds, then curate and record the sounds. The final selections will be sited in the neighborhood and marked by 
      small bronze plaques. Maps will be made available so that visitors can tour the sound sites, either physically or virtually. <br>
      <br>
      We hope this collaborative expansion will serve as a prototype for more Sound Maps throughout the city!  We'll keep you posted as we progress.<br>-->
